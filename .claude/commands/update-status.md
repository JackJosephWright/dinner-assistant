You are helping maintain the project status documentation for the dinner-assistant project.

## Your Task

Review the current conversation history and recent work, then update the appropriate status files to reflect:

1. **What was completed** - Features, fixes, refactoring, tests added
2. **Current state** - What's working, what's in progress
3. **Next steps** - What should be done next
4. **Any new insights** - Architecture decisions, gotchas, lessons learned

## Files to Update

Update ONE OR MORE of these files as appropriate:

- **`CLAUDE.md`** (if it exists) - High-level project context and architecture
- **`docs/archive/STATUS.md`** - Current project status snapshot
- **`docs/archive/PROGRESS.md`** - Detailed development progress tracking

## Guidelines

- Be concise but specific (include file paths, line numbers if relevant)
- Update metrics (tests passing, coverage, features complete)
- Note any technical debt or known issues discovered
- Update "Next Steps" sections to reflect current priorities
- Add git commit hashes for significant changes if available
- Keep the tone professional and factual

## Process

1. First, read the relevant status files to understand their structure
2. Summarize what work was done in this session
3. Ask the user if they want to review changes before writing
4. Update the files with the new information
5. Confirm what was updated

Start by reading the current status files and telling the user what you found.
